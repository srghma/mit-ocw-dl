# MIT-OCW Downloader

Download all video lectures from a MIT-OCW course with a single command.

## Features

  * Intentionally detailed names, so that it will display and sort properly
    on most interfaces (e.g., MX Video, or VLC on Android devices).
  * URL and lecture name filters to download only video files.
  * Tested on Linux, and Mac (Python 2.7).

## Instructions

  * [mit-ocw-dl][1] basically needs a link to the video lectures page of a MIT-OCW course
    (which of course has video lectures) and a computer that runs python.
  * Put the `download.py` file in the location you want the videos to be downloaded.
  * Get the `link` to the video lectures page of a MIT-OCW course.
  * Open up a shell-wizard and navigate to the `location`.
  * Type `python download.py link`
  * Enjoy !

## Coming Up
  *[mit-ocw-dl][1] only supports video content of the course presently
  but attempts are on to make it download entire contents (lecture slides, assignments, solutions etc.)
